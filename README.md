## Skills
### Python
I've used Python to automate some of my workload with custom **scripts** and create web apps with **Flask** (ie. [a blog platform](https://github.com/JereNurminen/blog-platform) and [a weather reporting app](https://github.com/JereNurminen/weather-app)). Currently falling in love with it.
### Javascript
I've done a few projects with **React** (both of the aforementioned projects used it, the former for its admin page and the latter for the whole front end). I'm also familiar with **Node**, having used it in [one *older* project](https://github.com/JereNurminen/nodejs_chat_webapp). I'm really interested in using both in the future.
### Java
Java has been with me since the beginning in the form of school projects, which mainly focused on it. I've created **Spring/Spring Boot** web apps and an **Android** e-learning app for a Finnish company in a team.
### PHP
There's no escaping PHP. I've used it for custom (and way too complicated) **WordPress** templates and very simple CRUD apps.
### Linux
I've hosted many of my projects on my own **virtual server**, and I've had to deal with configuring and troubleshooting it.
